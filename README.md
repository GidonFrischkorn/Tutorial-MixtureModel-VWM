# Tutorial: Mixture Models for visual working memory tasks

This repository contains R scripts &amp; raw data to illustrate how to estimate widely used mixture models (e.g. the Zhang &amp; Luck (2008) or the Bays et al. (2009) mixture models) for visual working memory tasks.

To ensure that all relative paths work, we have set up an R project with the following file structure:
-> Tutorial-MixtureModel-VWM.Rproj: open this project file in RStudio. That way all relative paths work 
- scripts: folder containing all R scripts
- output: folder for output files of R scripts (e.g. RData files containing brms model fits)
- figures: folder to save figures from R scripts
- data: folder containing benchmark data sets to evaluate mixture models
